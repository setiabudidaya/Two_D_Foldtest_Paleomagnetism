# Two_D_Foldtest_Paleomagnetism
This was the idea when I studied paleomagnetism at the University of Liverpool (UK) in 1988 - 1991 for my PhD work.
At that time, the computer program was written in fortran and used to analyze the paleomagnetic data 
from South Wales samples of carboniferous and devonian rocks. The results showed that the magnetization was syn-folding
in origin.
Led by Prof. Lisa Tauxe, python language instead of fortran has been used by many paleomagnetists. I am interested in 
rewriting the fortran 2D foldtest using python with the help of ipython notebook so it can also be used by others. 
I am new to python, ipython notebook and github but recently I joined the MOOC of Prof. Lorena Barba to learn all of these
and got 3 badges out of 7. This means that my comprehension in these fields is in average level  or may be less.
In doing this, I used module written by Prof. Lisa Tauxe (pmag,pmagplotlib,ipmag) especially for this foldtest 
ipmag.dotilt_V() and pmag.fisher_mean().
